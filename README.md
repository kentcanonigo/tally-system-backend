# Workflow Example

1. **Session Setup:**
    
    When Customer A is chosen for an operation, a new TallySession record is created, linking to Customer A.
    
2. **Input Customer Allocation:**
    
    The required allocations are inputâ€”for example, SQ = 40, US = 50, OS = 20. For each allocation, insert a record into AllocationDetail that includes the requestedHeads for that weight classification.
    
3. **Tallying Process:**
    - Tally-er: Inputs weights which are automatically classified (using the logic defined from the WeightClassification table) and increments the tallyErCount for the corresponding AllocationDetail record.
    - Dispatcher: Re-tallies and updates dispatcherCount for the corresponding records.
4. **Validation:**
    
    After the session, you can compare tallyErCount and dispatcherCount for each classification to flag any mismatches.
    
    Advantages of This Structure
    
    - Normalization: The weight ranges and labels are stored once in WeightClassification.
    - Flexibility: Each session (in TallySession) can have a dynamic set of allocations (in AllocationDetail), tailored to each customerâ€™s needs.
    - Simplicity in Queries: You can easily join TallySession, AllocationDetail, and WeightClassification to generate reports, compare tallies, and validate discrepancies.
    - Extensibility: If a customerâ€™s allocation changes over time, or if you need to add new classifications, you can do so without modifying multiple tables.
